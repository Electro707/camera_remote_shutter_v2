# P1010 - Camera Remote Shutter Project V2
#### Rev 1

This is an open-source camera remote shutter.

This was the second revision of the [original project](https://github.com/Electro707/camera_remote_shutter), but is now treated as a seperate project due to scope creep.

There are many issue with Rev 1, still WIP.

## PCB Artwork Revision
As this project was initially the second revision of my original shutter controller, I put Rev2 as the rev on the PCB. As this is now a seperate project, it is really Rev 1.

## Enclosure
WIP

There is a work-in-progress enclosure for the PCB under the [CAD](CAD) folder. The enclosure is made with FreeCAD 1.xx

## Firmware
WIP

## KiCAD 3D Models
